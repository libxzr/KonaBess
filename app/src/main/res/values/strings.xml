    <string name="help_msg">Welcome!\nBy using this tool, you can edit the GPU frequency table and voltage table of Snapdragon 855, 865, 888 and 765 series processors freely, such as overclocking and undervolt.\nThe following is an example to illustrate how to do overclocking: First, click \"Edit GPU freq table\", and it will show the frequency tables in the device. There may be multiple frequency tables in a device. I have annotated the frequency tables, but it may not accurate. So please judge which frequency table your device is using according to the frequency table in various GPU frequency adjustment softwares.\nClick a frequency table to show all frequencies in it, and then click \"new\" on top to copy the max frequency. Then click the copied new frequency to enter the parameter setting page, and click the \"frequency\" above to modify it according to the demand.\nAfter modification, click \"save\". After saving, you can click \"Edit GPU freq table\" again to refresh and view to confirm that the saving is successful.\nAnd then you can click \"Edit GPU volt table\". At this time, the available frequencies of all frequency tables will be displayed. If the frequency specified by the frequency table is not in the voltage table, it is inevitable that the phone will not able to boot. Then click \"new\" on top, and the max frequency will be copied. Then click the new frequency to enter it.\nClick \"frequency\" to change it to the frequency previously specified when editing the frequency table. Then, a suitable voltage level can be selected for this frequency.\nClick \"save\" again. After saving, you can click \"Edit GPU volt table\" again to refresh and view. Confirm that the saving is successful.\nAfter confirming that everything is OK, flash the image and restart the phone.\nIn a word, please make sure that the frequency in the frequency table exists in the volt table.</string>
