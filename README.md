### Overview

KonaBess is a straightforward application designed to customize GPU frequency and voltage tables without the need for kernel recompilation.

### How it Operates

The application achieves customization by unpacking the Boot/Vendor Boot image, decompiling and editing relevant dtb (device tree binary) files, and finally repacking and flashing the modified image.

### Usage Instructions

Refer to the "help" section for detailed instructions on usage.

### Why "KonaBess"?

- The name "Kona" corresponds to the code name of the Snapdragon 865 series.
- Given that the GPU of the Snapdragon 888 exhibits a decrease in energy efficiency, KonaBess allows users to overclock the Snapdragon 865 and surpass the performance of the Snapdragon 888. This is the motivation behind the app's creation.
- Despite the compatibility with Snapdragon 888, the app retains its original name.

### Performance Enhancement

The extent of improvement varies, with some users reporting a 25% reduction in power consumption in the graphics benchmark (4.2w->3.2w) after undervolting the Snapdragon 865. Actual improvement is chip-specific and contingent on stability requirements.
